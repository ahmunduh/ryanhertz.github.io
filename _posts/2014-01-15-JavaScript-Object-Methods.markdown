I've been a little confused about JavaScript methods. Methods can be added to the constructor, or to the object prototype. Here are some examples:

Adding a method to the constructor:

	function Box (x, y) {
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
		this.getArea = function () { return x*y};
	}

Adding a method using the prototype:

	function Box (x, y) {
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;		
	}
	Box.prototype.getArea = function () { return x*y};
	
This example may be a little too simple because the area could be represented as a property, but you get the idea.

One of the benefits of using the prototype is that the `getArea()` method is only declared once. Putting the method in the constructor causes a separate copy of the method to be created with every instance of the Box object. This probably isn't necessary because the `getArea()` method doesnâ€™t change for each instance.
