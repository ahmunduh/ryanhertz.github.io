I decided that it was time for a blog. I need a place where I can keep notes on new programming concepts and track my progress. I hope that writing about new concepts will improve my own understanding. If it helps other people out there on the internet, that's great too, however it seems unlikely.

###Which Platform###
The first step was to decide which platform to use. I wanted to try something I'd never used before, so WordPress was out. I didn't want to just sign up for a Tumblr account either. I thought it would be helpful if the platform I chose was built using some of the technologies I'm interested in learning. I narrowed it down to Ruby or Javascript and my first thought was Ghost, my limited hosting account doesn't support node.js. I considered creating my own blog with Rails or some sort of Javascript framework and Firebase, however needed something that would be fairly quick to set up. I wanted to be able to start writing and tracking my progress immediately.

###Jekyll###
I decided to go with [Jekyll] (http://jekyllrb.com) because it met most of my needs. No database is required, it's quick to set up, and hosting is super easy with [GitHub Pages] (http://pages.github.com/). I love that deployments are made with git. So far, I've already learned a few things about git, Ruby Gems, and bundler. And I'm more aware of static-site generators in general. [This post by Drew Barontini] (http://drewbarontini.com/articles/middleman/) is already more relevant to me than it would have been yesterday.

###Second Guessing###
I have a habit of second guessing myself, but I think Jekyll is the right choice for now. It doesn't matter if I have the best, most powerful blogging software. It's a learning tool and it is already working.
