I decided that it was time for a blog. I need a place where I can keep notes on new programming concepts and track my progress. I hope that writing about new concepts will improve my own understanding. Hopefully, one day it will some some other people out too.

###Which Platform###
First I had to decide which platform to use. I wanted to try something I'd never used before, so WordPress was out. I wanted a self-hosted platform that was built using some of the technologies I wanted to learn, so that ruled out Tumblr. I narrowed it down to something that used Ruby or Javascript. My first thought was [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), but my limited hosting account doesn't support node.js. I considered creating my own blog with Rails or some sort of Javascript framework, however I needed something that would be fairly quick to set up. I wanted to be able to start writing and tracking my progress immediately.

###Jekyll###
I decided to go with [Jekyll] (http://jekyllrb.com) because it met most of my needs. No database is required, it's quick to set up, and hosting is super easy with [GitHub Pages] (http://pages.github.com/). I like that deployments are made with git. As simple as it is, I've already learned a few things about git, Ruby Gems, bundler, and Liquid Templating Language.

###Second Guessing###
Immediatly after I got Jekyll set up, I saw [this post by Drew Barontini] (http://drewbarontini.com/articles/middleman/) on how Middleman is far superior. Still, I think Jekyll is a fine choice for now. Drew's setup looks pretty good, but I kind of want to figure it out on my own.
