In order to master a new skill, you need to revisit the subject at increasing intervals. As time goes by, and you are re-exposed to the new material, you can get away with longer and longer intervals between exposures. I have the tendency to blast through [Code School] (http://www.codeschool.com) courses during free weekends, and by the end of the course, I totally understand all the material. If I don't use what I've learned soon after completing the course, that information quickly fades away. If you really want to learn something, it's best to pace yourself. When you come back to a new subject after a few days, you have to review what you learned during the last session before moving on to new material. I think this is really the important part. New concepts are solidified through this process of review.

Sometimes being taught by a live person or video can really helpful, but being taught is not the same as learning. You really do learn by doing. A good teacher can explain a new subject so that it makes perfect since while you are listening. When you try to apply what you were taught, you find that it didn't stick as well as you thought. When you try to apply the new concept on your own, you are given the opportunities to make mistakes. The process of making mistakes, discovering them, and fixing them is where the learning happens.

It might sound like I don't value teachers, but that's not the case at all. It's just that the real value of teachers is not in their ability to communicate, but in their ability to motivate. I've been personally affected more than I care to admit by good and bad high school teachers. If you can motivate a student, all you have to do is get out of their way and they will learn. If a student isn't motivated, it doesn't really matter how good of a communicator the teacher is.
